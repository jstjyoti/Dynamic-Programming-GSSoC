## Dynamic Coding Repository 
This repository contains some useful codes, techniques, *algorithms*, *data structures* and problem solutions helpful in Dynamic Programming.

## Resources for learning and practicing
In terms of learning the ideas and theory behind dynamic programming, I'd like to recommend
the lectures in part 2 of the [Stanford Algorithms course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithm-design-analysis-2).
You can skip right to the dynamic programming lectures, they're in week 3. A lot of the materials for
this workshop were drawn from these lectures so some things will be familiar.

Besides that, I'd recommend 2 things:

1. Practicing lots of problems in the dynamic programming category on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/)
2. Searching for other videos / explanations of some of the more "classic" DP algorithms. A couple I'd recommend learning about are:
  * The Coin Change problem
  * String edit distance (helps you solve a whole class of string matching problems, like RegEx matching, etc. I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q2IEIY2pDU) video and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAVGRWSryGo) video to be really helpful, both from a Coursera course on gene sequencing)
  * The Knapsack problem (covered in the workshop)
  * The Longest Common Subsequence algorithm


### How to contribute
1. #### Algorithms
- Choose a algorithm of that you wish to implement.
- In the [Algorithms](Algorithms/) folder, if you don't find a suitable folder in which category this algorithm belongs, then create that folder, otherwise go to the existing one.
- Create a separate folder inside it with the name of the Algorithm. 
- Add your file, commit and send a pull request.
